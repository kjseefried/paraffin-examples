\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:introduction}
Paraffin is a set of Ada 2012 generics that may be used to add
parallelism to iterative loops and recursive code.

Paraffin includes generics for both Ravenscar and non-Ravenscar use.
The Ravenscar version utilizes static task pools with dispatching
domains intended for real-time programming.

Paraffin also includes Paraffinalia, which is a suit of useful parallel
utilities that utilize the Paraffin generics. These include generics for;

\begin{itemize}
   \item generic to integrating a function in parallel
   \item generic to apply quicksort algorithm in parallel to an array
   \item generic to apply fast fourier transform to an array of data.
   \item generic Red-Black tree container that performs some operations
      in parallel.
   \item function to solve matrices using Gauss-Jordan Elimination
   \item generic to perform prefix sum calculations
   \item generic to perform sequence alignment using the Smith-Waterman
      algorithm to find similar regions between two strings for
      problems such as comparing genetic nucleotide or protein sequences,
      or checking for plagiarism between two text sourcs.
\end{itemize}

The current posted version of the code is intended to be compiled
only with Ada 2012 compilers, though archived versions can also be
downloaded that support Ada 2005 compilers. The interfaces between
the Ada 2012 and the Ada 2005 versions are now quite different,
but at some point, the current interfaces may get back ported to
the Ada 2005 version, at some point.

This paper gives you some hints on how to get started with your own parallel
application.

\chapter{Installing Parffine}\label{ch:installing}

Releases of Paraffine are hosted at 
\url{https://sourceforge.net/projects/paraffin}. The development is done at 
at \url{http://git-scm.com/}. You may checkout the 
latest development version by:
\footnote{Development Repository}
\begin{verbatim}
mkdir sandbox
cd sandbox
git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/paraffin/code paraffin-code
\end{verbatim}

\section{Creating your sandbox}\label{sec:sandboc}

Install first Paraffin, after this has been done get the release (a zip file) of the
example package from \url{https://github.com/merdmann/paraffin-expamples} and 
unzip it into some directory of your choice. Set the environment variables shown below to point to the root directory of the parafine release.

\begin{verbatim}
export PARAFFIN_ROOT="/home/merdmann/......"
\end{verbatim}

Change into the directory example1 and call the gps for the first example.

\chapter{Paraffin in a nutshell}
For iterative parallelism, three main flavours of parallelism generics
exist within paraffin.

\begin{itemize}
   \item Work-Sharing
   \item Work-Seeking
   \item Work-Stealing
\end{itemize}
   
For recursive parallelism, only Work-Sharing and Work-Seeking forms
exist.

For each parallelism approach, there are 3 cases;

\begin{itemize}
   \item elementary (functional) reduction
   \item composite  (procedural) reduction
   \item no reduction
\end{itemize}

The elementary (functional) reducing generics are intended to be used
when a final result needs to be generated, and the type of the final
result is an elementary type (i.e. Integer, Boolean, Float).

The elementary generics essentially are oneres that return the final
reduction result as a function return value, rather than an in out
parameter of a procedure.

It is not strictly necessary that the type be an elementary type,
however, it is likely that for composite types, better performance will
result from using the composite generics, since function returns involve
copying the result into a result variable, whereas procedure calls act
on the parameter directly without having to make a copy.

The composite (procedural) reducing generics are intended to be used
when a final result needs to be generated, and the type of the final
result is a composite type (i.e. record, tagged type).
That is not to say that elementary types cannot be used. You may find
that elementary types perform well with the composite generics as well.

The remaining class of generics do not produce a final result, and
therefore do not involve any reduction. These generics are useful when
there is only a need to iterate or recurse in parallel.

\chapter{Your first program}

A typical application of parallel computing is a calculation which derives
from a given vector \begin{math} X(t) \in R^N \end{math} a new vector 
\begin{math} X(t+\bigtriangleup t) \in R^N\end{math} by performing the following 
caculation:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
\footnote{ 
The movement of a collection of particles is described by the newtons law, which means
the change of the movement, exactly speaking the momentum, depends on the forces acting 
on a particle. This statement can be written in the form below.

\begin{equation}
m_{i}\frac{dv_{i}}{dt}\mid_{x(t)}=\sum_{j=1}^{N}F(x_{i}(t),x_{j}(t))
\end{equation}

In order to calculate the evolution of a mechanical system without solving explicitly 
the corresponding differential equations this equation needs to be integrated numerically.

This can be done by means of well known numerical methods for each particle. From a high
level perspective the integration is a sequence of iterations which are calculating for a given 
time interval from the previous state the final state.

\begin{equation}
p'_1,...,p'_n=I(p_1,...,p_n)
\end{equation}

\includegraphics{graphics/central3.png}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
}

\begin{equation}
X_i(t+ \bigtriangleup t)=F_i(X_i(t)) \;\; (i \in 1..N)
 \label{eq:iteration}
\end{equation}

The algorithm is straight forward and it shows clearly this loop 
may be executed in parallel on multiple processors sine the calculation 
may be brocken down in indendant partitions.

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{A loop algoritm}
\label{alg:loop}
\begin{algorithmic}
\For { $i \in 1..N$ }
    \State{ $X1(i) \gets{F(i,X0)} $ }
\EndFor
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Paraffin provides for such an problem so called paralell loops. \autoref{lst:example1}
shows the implementation of equation \autoref{eq:iteration}. The main element of the 
caculation is the function F which computes the value of \begin{math} 
X_i(t+ \bigtriangleup t) \end{math} for all \begin{math}i \in 1..N\end{math}. 
This function is called by the function Do{\textunderscore}Partition which in turn is called by Paraffin with the smallest and the largest component to be calculated.
